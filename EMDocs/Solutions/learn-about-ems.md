 Securing productivity, collaboration and enterprise data is critically important as organizations digitally transform and Microsoft is committed to delivering a new approach to secure this transition.

## What’s included in EMS?
It’s easy to [buy Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security-pricing). To keep things simple, each product is priced per user, not per device, and there are also volume discounts.

You can purchase EMS licenses through either the EMS E3 or EMS E5 offering. With EMS E5, you get everything included in E3 along with additional cloud security capabilities as you can see in the following table:

## Office 365 and EMS. Better together.
EMS enables your employees to unlock the full potential of Office 365, the professional standard for cloud-based productivity software.

### Seamless productivity experience
Together, Office 365 and EMS give employees the best productivity experience, with the familiar productivity apps they love, wherever they happen to be working. Office 365 enables employees to work and collaborate from virtually anywhere with access to email, calendar, and productivity apps from nearly any device. Combined with EMS services, organizations can also provide their employees with access to other corporate applications, data, and resources from nearly any location on any device, while keeping sensitive data protected without the need for complex security configurations.

### Unburden your IT department
Manage all the cloud services that come with Office 365, including emails, sites to share documents, conferencing, and productivity applications. EMS integration enables users to seamlessly connect with cloud applications and resources using a single identity that Azure Active Directory Premium can authenticate, regardless of location or device. The single identity option allows users to conduct their own self-service, redirecting the troubleshooting responsibility from IT to the user. Users have the ability to self-manage groups and password resets.  

### Increase business agility
The capability to share, and share securely, is built into the Office 365 foundation, making data sharing simple, readily available, and intuitive like never before. The integration of Azure Information Protection services with Office 365 eliminates the need for complex configurations in order for users to share sensitive information within and outside their organization. Senders have the ability to define privileges and editing capabilities based on the user or file. Administrators can also enforce policies using custom templates that give IT the ability to define policies that meet business and compliance requirements.

### Use EMS to protect application access on Windows
In addition to features included with Windows 10 Enterprise like enhanced security with Windows Passport and support for auto MDM enrollment, EMS provides conditional access with multi-factor authentication (MFA) across devices and apps leveraging Windows device health data. Help desk tasks are simplified by enabling users through self-service group and application management and password reset with write-back to on-premises directory. Access is simplified and protected through secure remote access and SSO to on-premises web applications with no need for VPN.

### Flexible device, application, and access management
Windows 10 Enterprise comes ready with built-in support for mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) capabilities, support for corporate app distribution leveraging the Windows Store for Business, and advanced operating system distribution and upgrade support. In addition, EMS gives you the ability to automatically enroll PCs into MDM (via Azure AD Premium) and use MAM across Windows, iOS, and Android in a single tool. EMS makes choosing how to managed Windows 10 PCs easy with the flexibility to choose between modern, internet-based and clientless device management via Intune or traditional, agent-based management of domain joined Windows PCs via System Center Configuration Manager.
- Windows in-place upgrade & OS deployment via System Center Configuration Manager
- Certificate, WiFi, VPN, email profile provisioning

### Help secure data everywhere
You already get corporate application isolation and management, automatic encryption for data on the device (including while roaming and backups), and storage of Bitlocker device encryption keys in Azure, but with EMS you also get the ability to:
- Encrypt data during collaboration with consistent experiences across multiple device platforms.
- Track protected files and revoke access to files.
- Advanced cloud security reports based on machine learning and on-premises behavioral analytics for advanced threat detection of known malicious attacks and security issues.
- Simple, actionable reporting of suspicious activity with alerts with next step recommendations.
- Integration with your existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
