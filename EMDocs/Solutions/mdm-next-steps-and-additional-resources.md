Now that you’ve completed defining your requirements and examining all the options for your mobile device management solution, you’re ready to take the next steps for deploying the supporting infrastructure that’s right for you and your organization.

## Mobile device management solutions 

Leveraging specific solution scenarios that fit your needs is a great way to review and plan for the details of deploying a mobile device management infrastructure. The following solutions outline several of the most common mobile device management scenarios: 

- The [manage mobile devices and PCs in enterprise environments](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn582037.aspx) solution helps you manage mobile devices by extending your on-premises System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager infrastructure into the cloud with Microsoft Intune. This hybrid infrastructure helps medium and large companies enable BYOD and remote access while reducing administration complexity. 
- The [managing mobile devices for Configuration Manager 2007](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn508400.aspx) solution helps you manage mobile devices when your infrastructure rests on System Center Configuration Manager 2007. This solution shows you how to set up a single server running System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager so you can then run Microsoft Intune and take advantage of its MDM capabilities.
- The [managing mobile devices in small environments](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn715906.aspx) solution is intended for small businesses that need to support MDM. It explains how to use Microsoft Intune to extend your current infrastructure to support mobile device management and BYOD. This solution describes the simplest scenario supported for using Microsoft Intune in a standalone, cloud-only configuration without local servers.
        
## Mobile device management documentation

Conceptual and procedural planning, deployment, and administration content are useful when implementing your mobile device management solution:

- The [Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Design Considerations Guide](./BYOD-design-considerations-guide.md) can help you identify critical design considerations that need to be addressed before designing a BYOD solution that enables your employees to use their own devices and protects your company’s data.
- [Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc507089.aspx) solutions can help you capture and aggregate knowledge about your infrastructure, policies, processes, and best practices so that your IT staff can build manageable systems and automate operations.
- [Microsoft Intune](/Intune/) is a cloud-based device management service that helps you to manage your computers and mobile devices and to secure your company’s information.
- [MDM for Office 365](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ms.o365.cc.devicepolicy.aspx) allows you to manage and secure mobile devices when they're connected to your Office 365 organization. You can use MDM for Office 365  to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices if they’re lost or stolen. Get an overview of the features and setup steps for MDM in Office 365 in [Explore the built-in Mobile Device Management (MDM) feature for Office 365](https://blogs.office.com/2015/07/21/explore-the-built-in-mobile-device-management-mdm-feature-for-office-365/).
