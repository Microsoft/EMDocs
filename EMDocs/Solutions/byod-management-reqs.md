# Management requirements

Device management is one of the foundations of any people-centric strategy, and it must be evaluated against a company’s requirements. Depending on the maturity level of the company, a management system might be in place already that will need to be expanded to cover the BYOD scenarios that the company is adopting. Figure below shows management interactions when managing users, devices, and data. Considerations must be made for each component of the Management subdomain.

When considering management capability requirements, you should start by asking the questions listed in the next section.

## Questions to ask

Management requirements questions are categorized in seven areas:

- Monitoring
- Reporting
- Configuration
- Compute
- Storage
- Automation
- Deployment and provisioning


### Monitoring

- Does your company need to monitor compliance settings such as password, camera, and encryption on users’ devices?
- Does your company want to differentiate device ownership (company-owned devices versus user-owned devices)?
- Does your company want to allow users to reset their passwords from their own devices?
- Does your company need to have logging capability built into the management system?
- Does your company need auditing capabilities built into the management system?
- Does your company aggregate this type of logging in a single repository?

### Reporting

- Does your company need reporting capabilities for its BYOD model?
	- If so, which types of reports (such as updates, software installed, and inventory) will be necessary?
- Does the management system in place have these reporting requirements?
	- If so, is it possible to customize them?
- Is there any differentiation in the reporting requirements for domain-joined devices and non-domain joined devices?
	- If so, what are the requirements for each scenario?

### Configuration

- Does your company need a management system that requires users’ devices to be domain-joined in order to be managed?
- Does your company need a management system that integrates with your current directory?
- Does your company need a management system that manages just apps, or should it also manage the operating system running on users’ devices?
- Does your company need a management system that can enforce policies on users’ devices?
- Does your company need a management system that can be integrated with cloud services?
- Does your company plan to perform selective wipe in case a user no longer needs access to the apps that were installed?
	- If so, does the management system in place support selective wipe capability?

### Compute

- What are the compute capabilities required to run the management system on back-end servers?
- What are the compute capabilities required to run the management system on users’ devices?
- Does the management system support leveraging cloud capability to expand on-premises compute resources?

### Storage

- What are the storage requirements to run the management system on back-end servers?
- What are the storage requirements to run the management system on users’ devices?
- Does the management system support leveraging cloud capabilities to expand on-premises storage resources?
- Does the company need to manage external storage drives that are added to users’ devices?
- Does the company need a management system that is also capable of integrating with cloud storage?

### Automation

- Which operations does your company plan to automate for BYOD scenarios?
- What are the automation requirements for the management system that your company plans to adopt?
- Does your current management system support built-in command-line or script automation?
- Does your company have a management system that integrates with cloud services and provides automation capabilities?

### Deployment and Provisioning

- What are the requirements for management agent deployment for your current management system?
- Will any services be offered to remote users that can be instantly provisioned via a portal?
- Are personal devices registered with the company by IT, or are they registered personally?
- Will a plan be in place to allow users to provision services using their own devices?
	- If so, does the management system natively enable users to perform this operation from their devices?
